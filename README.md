# Angular-beginner

To start first you have to install node js and also have anycode editor of your choice i'm using visual studio code

After installing it type node --version to sure of the version and also check whether it is installed

Then type npm init

After you do tsc __init

For me the tsc wasn't working for me so i used npx tsc __init and it worked

In this repository are some basics of typescript before going into angular

Some of the things you will learn is datatypes,array, emu,classes and other

I will be updating this repository every day
